# Example ~/.zshrc (keep your real one private)
#
# Recommended approach:
# - Keep `~/.zshrc` as a regular file (not a symlink into this repo).
# - Source the repo-managed zsh config fragment.
# - Put machine/user-specific secrets and tweaks in `~/.zshrc.local` (not committed).

# Source dotfiles zsh config (installed by `./macos/bin/bootstrap-terminal`)
[[ -f "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/zsh/dotfiles.zsh" ]] && source "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/zsh/dotfiles.zsh"

# Optional local-only overrides
[[ -f "$HOME/.zshrc.local" ]] && source "$HOME/.zshrc.local"
